            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                Hedy Lamarr was an Austro-Hungarian-born American actress and inventor.
                She was born Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler on November 9, 1914 in Vienna,
                Austria. She began her film career in Czechoslovakia, but fled from her
                first husband and moved to Paris, where she met Louis B. Mayer, head of
                Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios. He offered her a movie contract in
                Hollywood, and she became a film star with her performance in Algiers
                (1938).

            <p>
                Lamarr acted in a number of MGM films, including Lady of the Tropics
                (1939), Boom Town (1940), H. M. Pulham, Esq. (1941), and White Cargo
                (1942). Her greatest success was as Delilah in Cecil B. DeMille's
                Samson and Delilah (1949). She also acted on television before the
                release of her final film, The Female Animal (1958).

                At the beginning of World War II, Lamarr and avant-garde composer
                George Antheil co-invented a radio guidance system for Allied torpedoes
                that used spread spectrum and frequency hopping technology to defeat
                the threat of radio jamming by the Axis powers. Lamarr was inducted into
                the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2014.

                honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960.
